## 🧰 Contribute Tools, Fixes & Scripts

You can add:
- Magisk modules (e.g. permissive, DFE, etc.)
- Flashable zips for Wi-Fi/camera/audio

👉 Place them in the correct folder under `tools/`, and update `tools/README.md` with a short description.

All guides are in Markdown. If you have a better method, or a fix that works on newer devices:
- Navigate to the correct guide file
- Edit using pull request, or fork and submit changes

Please keep the format clean and detailed!

## 📷 Submit Logs or Sample Ports

Want to share logs or results from your device?

- Add logs in `logs/` with a clear filename (`logcat_redmi12_bootloop.txt`)
- Add sample ports in `samples/<device-name>/`
- Include `base_rom.txt`, `gsi_used.txt`, and `port_notes.md`

Before reporting:
- Check the [Pinned Q&A Issue](https://github.com/rajdeep-3305/porting-guide/issues) for help
- Try to include `logcat`, `dmesg`, or `getprop` output

Use labels when submitting if possible:

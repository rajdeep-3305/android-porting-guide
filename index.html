  <h2>The Catch!!</h2>

  <h3>There are things we need to be sure of before proceeding to build... I mean minimum requirements...</h3>
  <p>
    Technically if you have the following "minimum requirements" you're good to go...
    This is actually the bare minimum spec. I say this because I've personally done builds with my shitty Laptop and came to this conclusion... Yes! I did a lot of tweaks and yada yada yada but still not much help... So listen to me here... friend to friend... if this couldn't be achieved... Please don't try!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A linux Environment (Recommended : Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).</li>
    <li>A decent Internet Connection (Better if it's a 1Mb/S plan at the least). Because ROM sources could be 16 GB approx. even when shallow cloned..</li>
    <li>CPU: 4 core 8 thread is the bare minimum or else it takes an eternity to build...</li>
    <li>RAM: 8 GB Minimum (+ ZRAM + SWAP optional and it is better to have 16 Gigs of RAM afterall).</li>
    <li>Storage: SSD is better and it will build if you have HDD too.. 250GB is a decent amount of space.</li>
    <li>Some Linux knowledge and Basic ideas about Git.</li>
    <li>You need to have the TREES.. (Device Tree, Kernel Tree {Or use a prebuilt one - not recommended}, Vendor Tree {And A Common Tree if available})</li>
    <li>A GitHub Account or a GitLab account! (Preferably with the trees forked/imported).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alright! Now we're talking.. yaay! good to go!!</p>

  <h4>Set Up a Build Environment</h4>
  <p>Step 1: Just make sure you satisfy the minimum requirements!</p>

  <h4>Downloading a ROM Source</h4>
  <p>Step 2: Downloading the source of your preferred ROM!</p>

  <h4>Know your Device sources aka Tree</h4>
  <p>Step 3: No Trees... No Builds... Find or Make Trees!</p>

  <h4>Basic Bringup and Sync device source</h4>
  <p>Step 4: Find your trees. Sync them... and do ROM Bringup</p>

  <h4>Lets build it!</h4>
  <p>Step 5: Dang... time to cook it!</p>

  <h4>Upload to SourceForge</h4>
  <p>Step 6: You can skip this if you know how to upload elsewhere</p>

  <p>
    Build-boting or Blind building of ROMs are really not recommended. Simply because they have no point and lacks quality!.
    However, this is how we learn... at least this is how I learned! Just don't make this a habit. And never release untested builds... get a tester from your community or test it yourself!
  </p>

  <h4>Golden Rule 1</h4>
  <p>Never PM Pros unless you really really really need help! They do quality work and are better left undisturbed!</p>

  <h4>Golden Rule 2</h4>
  <p>Never ever ever build as ROOT! (At this point... you should know what this means).</p>

  <h4>Golden Rule 3</h4>
  <p>Don't be a Retard! There is an Android Build Help group on telegram! Check rules and ask for help there...</p>

  <p>
    AndroidBuildersHelp group does not belong to me... And this is by far the most important GOLDEN RULE!
  </p>
  
  <h3>Team</h3>
  <p>So far it's just me! DUH!</p>

  <h2>The Catch!!</h2>
  <h3>There are things we need to be sure of before proceeding to port... I mean minimum requirements...</h3>
  <p>
    This is the bare minimum spec required. If you cannot meet these, please don't try, as it will likely lead to frustration.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A Linux Environment (Recommended: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).</li>
    <li>A decent Internet Connection (Better if it's a 1Mb/s plan at the least). Because sources can be very large.</li>
    <li>CPU: 4 cores and 8 threads is the bare minimum, or else it takes an eternity to build.</li>
    <li>RAM: 8GB Minimum (+ ZRAM + SWAP optional, but it is better to have 16GB of RAM).</li>
    <li>Storage: An SSD is better, but an HDD will work. 250GB is a decent amount of space.</li>
    <li>Some Linux knowledge and basic ideas about Git.</li>
    <li>You need to have the device **TREES** (Device Tree, Kernel Tree, and Vendor Tree).</li>
    <li>A GitHub Account (Preferably with your device trees forked/imported).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alright! Now we're talking. You're good to go!</p>

  <h4>Setup & Pre-Requisites</h4>
  <p>Step 1: Just make sure you satisfy the minimum requirements and have your build environment ready!</p>

  <h4>Porting GSIs</h4>
  <p>Step 2: Learn to port a Generic System Image (GSI) as a starting point.</p>

  <h4>Recovery Porting</h4>
  <p>Step 3: Build and port a custom recovery like TWRP or OrangeFox for your device.</p>

  <h4>Debugging Recovery & Bootloops</h4>
  <p>Step 4: Understand how to read logs (logcat, dmesg) to fix issues when your device won't boot.</p>

  <h4>AVB/Permissive Fixes</h4>
  <p>Step 5: Learn to patch AVB (Android Verified Boot) and set the kernel to permissive for testing.</p>

  <h4>Finalizing and Sharing</h4>
  <p>Step 6: Clean up your work and prepare to share it with the community.</p>

  <p>
    Blindly following guides without understanding the steps is not recommended. It lacks quality and you won't learn much. However, this is how we all start. Just don't make this a habit, and never release untested ports.
  </p>

  <h4>Golden Rule 1</h4>
  <p>Never PM developers for help unless you have truly exhausted all other options. They do quality work and are better left undisturbed!</p>

  <h4>Golden Rule 2</h4>
  <p>Never ever ever build as ROOT! (At this point, you should know what this means).</p>

  <h4>Golden Rule 3</h4>
  <p>Don't be afraid to ask for help! There are many communities like the Android Porting Telegram group. Check the rules and ask for help there.</p>
